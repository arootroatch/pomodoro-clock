# Pomodoro Clock

This project was done as part of freeCodeCamp's Front End Frameworks certification. I used React, Redux, and SCSS. The branch `fun-version` includes extra features, including:

- `select` elements to set "Break" and "Session" durations
- Randomized, fun messages during "Break" times
